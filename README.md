Note: If the output is more than one line and looks messy, just change the terminal window size to make it look like the screenshot above.

Instructions:

  2. On Github, click on the green button that says "Clone or download", then "Download ZIP".
  3. Extract the zipped/compressed folder and open the resulting folder.
  4. Run main.py
